200~# Python - If/Else, Loops, and Functions

This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate the fundamentals of conditional statements, loops, and functions.  

## Topics Covered

1. **If/Else Statements**  
   - Execute code based on conditions using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.  
   - Examples include checking if a number is positive, negative, or zero.  

2. **Loops**  
   - Use `for` loops to iterate over sequences like lists or ranges.  
   - Use `while` loops for repeated execution until a condition is met.  
   - Examples include counting, iterating over items, and repeating tasks.  

3. **Functions**  
   - Define reusable blocks of code using `def`.  
   - Pass arguments, return values, and organize code into modular components.  
   - Examples include performing calculations, printing messages, or processing data.  

## Learning Outcomes

By studying these scripts, you will understand how to:

- Control program flow with conditionals  
- Repeat tasks efficiently with loops  
- Structure code with functions for readability and reusability
